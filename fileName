I love supporting small, local business, and this place is great. Service was very friendly.  Not prompt but not slow either so relaxed for lunch.  Issue with a dirty spoon and a dirty glass. Meat sliders, fresh salad, and potato salad were awesome.  All were very comforting. Clam chowder was solid.  BBQ chicken wrap was ok.  Chicken was kinda dry and didn't have flavor on its own.  The rest of the wrap was tasty though. Interior decor was nice and unexpected for a pub.  It did feel little more like an eatery than a pub, but the menu is pretty limited without quite enough range.  I enjoy a concise menu, but they don't have french fries or onion rings, pub without those two thing. I will suggest."},{"Name":"Tom C.","Place":"Los Angeles, CA","Rating":"4.0","reviewCount":"40 reviews","friendCount":"58 friends","ReviewComment":"Great time and nice location as to be the place for next time.Accepting this for their good fast and cordial service as well.
